# Lightcycles
make your terminal look like lightcycles from Tron :)
heavily(and I mean heavily) inspired by pipes.sh

## Installation
first, make sure cargo is installed
```
cargo --version
```

navigate to your intended directory and install
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/arael34/lightcycles
```

you should now be able to run it.
```
lightcycles
```
